# Matching to planet classes are done via name matching (trait_PLANET_CLASS_KEY_preference) or using setting ideal_planet_class.
# ideal_planet_class = pc_desert # Must be set and match an existing planet class or the trait will not be treated as a habitability trait.
# Those traits that create one to one relation between the trait and species ideal planet class can be considered as habitability traits.
# Note that only one habitability trait can be assigned to a species because habitability traits are mutually exclusive.
# Aside from having proper habitability traits, which define ideal_planet_class for species, there is also a posibility to define bound_to_planet_classes entry for a trait.
# That entry can contain a list of planet classes and that will allow to create a logical connection between the trait and listed planet classes. So f.e. when in empire editor
# a home planet is selected for the species that cannot have 'ideal planet class' an additional search for the trait that is bound to plannet classes happens. If such trait is
# found it is added to the species. Bound to the planet classes traits works mostly the same way as habitability traits, but they don't set ideal_planet_class for species.
