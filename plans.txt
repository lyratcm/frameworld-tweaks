# write documentation - add to already existing situation log
# start efficiency lower and be increased with upgrade tier, make hab/ecu upgrades kilo (increase efficiency), mega upgrades mega (move tech exponent reduction to this and increase efficiency) and giga upgrades giga (move ringworld exponent to this), scale efficiency with hab? - power increase it instant rather than growth reduction being over time
# make hab affect efficiency from outposts
# bio trophy reductions?
# log for path to next upgrades
# 16x bonuses - alderson disk maybe although the origin gets pretty strong as this point maybe reduce exponent once more

# test non-overwriting merge? - talk to gigas team about moving some of my ow into code - would help with compat with the other frameworld sub mod
# gigas ehof district support

# remove ascension breakthrough
